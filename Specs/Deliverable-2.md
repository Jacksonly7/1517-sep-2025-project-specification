# Deliverable 2

This portion of the lab consists of a the functioning CRUD component for creating/editing information in a single database table, supported by services in the BLL.

## CRUD – Single Item CRUD

On this component, the student must provide a means to

* **Insert** new rows of data into a table
* **Update** an existing row of data in a table
* **Delete** (or mark as inactive/not current) a row of data in a table
* **Cancel** editing (clear the form)
* **Return to Query** returns to the `Query` component

### Alter Query component to transfer to CRUD component

Alter your Query component to contain a button/link that will transfer you to the CRUD component for entering a new record. Alter each tabular line to transfer an appropriate piece of data to the CRUD component so the associated database record can be retreived and displayed.

### CRUD Form

Your `CRUD` component will use an **EditForm**. The form will use the entity validation annotations. The table entity being maintained in your scenario will required custom error messages on the validation annotations. The entity annotations will be limited (unless otherwise authorized or augmented by your instructor) to Required, StringLength, Range, and EmailAddress. Error messages will be display beneath the appropriate field. You will need a success feed back message area. You may also have a validation summary area. Format layout of your form for your scenario is at your degression.  

### Processing Delete

Depending on the scenario and the table, the Delete functionality may not be a physical removal of a row of data. This is because some tables have triggers or other constraints that prevent the removal of existing rows. In these cases where a row cannot be deleted (excluding foreign key constraints preventing removal), the table will have some means of flagging the row as being inactive or not current. **Consult your specific scenario for further guidance on this matter.**

## Evaluation - *15%*

> ***NOTE:** Your code **must** compile. Solutions that do not compile will receive an automatic mark of zero (0).*
>
> If you are unable to get a portion of the assignment to compile, you should:
>
> - Comment out the non-compiling portion of code
> - Identify the non-compiling portion in the **Incomplete Requirements** heading, noting the item's
>   - File name (e.g.: "Account.cs")
>   - Line number(s)
>   - Compiler error number and general message

Your assignment will be marked based upon the following weights. See the [general rubric](./ReadMe.md#generalized-marking-rubric) for details.

| Weight | Earned | Deliverable/Requirement |
| ---- | --------- | -----------------|
| 1 |     | `Query` transfer to CRUD page Button (new record) |
| 4 |     | `CRUD` Editform setup and structure, Entity custom annotation messages|
| 1 |     | `CRUD` Cancel/Return button(s)|
| 2 |     | `BLL` insert new record service method |
| 2 |     | `CRUD` insert new record |
| 2 |     | `BLL` Update existing record service method |
| 2 |     | `CRUD` Update existing record |
| 2 |     | `BLL` Delete existing row (physical / logical)  service method |
| 2 |     | `CRUD` Delete existing row (physical / logical) |
| 2 |     | Appropriate demonstration of incremental development for the deliverable via commits. |
