# CPSC1517 Project Specs

> ***StarTED*** Database - A simple database for a post-secondary school. Follow the [Database Installation Instructions](./Database/ReadMe.md) to set up **Star-TED** on your computer.

## Overview

This document outlines the marking guide and general requirements for the lab. You are expected to work on a **single** scenario from the [catalogue of scenarios](./Scenarios/ReadMe.md) developed for the [***StarTED*** database](./Database/ReadMe.md). Your instructor will provide information on how to determine your specific scenario. Each scenario revolves around generating two fully-functional components:

* Query – Data Lookup with Tabular Display.
* CRUD – Single item Create/Read/Update/Delete.

Your instructor will provide any additional information on submitting/demonstrating the lab.

## The Deliverables

This project is divided into several deliverables, outlined below.  The due dates for each deliverable are ***subject to change***.

* [**Deliverable 1:** - 10 %](./Deliverable-1.md) – Due Dec 5 2025 midnight: Week 13
  * Query component.
* [**Deliverable 2:** - 15 %](./Deliverable-2.md) – Due Dec 16 2025 5:00 pm: Week 15
  * CRUD component.

> Each deliverable part is cumulative, building on previous deliverable parts of the solution. For each deliverable, any and all supporting functionality of previous deliverables must function correctly in order to gain marks for the demonstrated deliverable.
>
> Frequent commits and syncs of your work is **required** to demonstrate incremental development of your project. **Failure to demonstrate incremental work** will result in penalty marks to a maximum of 25% for the deliverable.
> 
> Your instructor is free to make changes and/or additions to this lab and its marking guide(s). ***You*** are responsible to make sure that you are up-to-date with all the changes/additions made by your instructor.
>
> ***Late labs or failure to demonstrate as required will receive a mark of zero for each affected deliverable.***

## Generalized Marking Rubric

The following generalized marking rubric will be applied to items in your individual exercises.

| Weight | Breakdown |
| ----- | --------- |
| **1** | 1 = Proficient (requirement is met, class standards followed)<br />0 = Incomplete (requirement not met, missing large portions, class standards not followed) |
| **2** | 2 = Proficient (requirement is met, class standards followed)<br />1 = Limited (requirement is poorly met, minor errors, class standards not followed)<br />0 = Incomplete (requirement not met, missing large portions, major errors, class standards not followed) |
| **3** | 3 = Proficient (requirement is met, class standards followed)<br />2 = Capable (requirement is adequately met, minor errors, class standards followed)<br />1 = Limited (requirement is poorly met, major errors, class standards not followed)<br />0 = Incomplete (requirement not met, missing large portions, major errors, class standards not followed) |
| **4** | 4 = Proficient (requirement is met, class standards followed)<br />3 = Capable (requirement is adequately met, minor errors, class standards followed)<br />2 = Acceptable (requirement is partially met, minor errors, class standards not followed)<br />1 = Limited (requirement is poorly met, major errors, class standards not followed)<br />0 = Incomplete (requirement not met, missing large portions, major errors, class standards not followed) |
| **5** | 5 = Proficient (requirement is met, class standards followed)<br />4 = Capable (requirement is adequately met, minor errors, class standards followed)<br />3 = Acceptable (requirement is partially met, minor errors, class standards not followed)<br />2 = Sub-Par (requirement is partially met, major errors, class standards not followed)<br />1 = Limited (requirement is poorly met, major errors, class standards not followed)<br />0 = Incomplete (requirement not met, missing large portions, major errors, class standards not followed) |
| **10** | 10 = **Proficient** (requirement is fully met, class standards followed)<br />8 = **Capable** (requirement is adequately met, minor errors, class standards followed)<br />6 = **Acceptable** (requirement is partially met, minor errors, class standards not followed)<br />4 = **Sub-Par** (requirement is partially met, significant errors, class standards not followed)<br />2 = **Limited** (requirement is poorly met, major errors)<br />0 = **Incomplete** (requirement not met, missing large portions, class standards not followed) |
